# Coastal Echoes 
## Introduction
Coastal Echoes is an innovative project combining real-time environmental data with interactive visualization techniques to present dynamic coastal scenes. It utilizes real-time tidal and wind data to animate coastal landscapes visually, allowing the physical reproduction of natural phenomena such as wave motion and beach coverage. This project serves as both a functional tool for marine enthusiasts and an artistic decoration.
## Project Goals
The main objective of Coastal Echoes is to integrate real-time environmental data with Internet of Things technology to generate dynamic representations of coastal environments, helping target users such as shell collectors, surfers, and beachgoers understand and visualize tidal and wind impacts in real-time.
## Features
* Real-Time Data Visualization: Using tide and wind data to illustrate their effects on wave motion and beach coverage.
* Physical Prototype: Features a motorized mechanism that simulates ocean wave movements correlated with real-time wind speed data.
* LED Visualization: An LED strip displays tide levels with color gradients, enhancing visual feedback.
* User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be intuitive and accessible for all user types.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2
* MG90S 9G Micro Servo
* LED strips
* Water corrugated acrylic board
* Access to the Open Meteo API and Environment Agency API for real-time environmental data
